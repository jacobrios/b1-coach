// The synthetic hitter: fifteen made-up swings for one practice session.
//
// There is no real TrackMan feed behind this app, so every number a visitor
// sees after session 1 comes from here. That makes this file the place where
// the demo is either believable or not.
//
// It used to be a closure inside App.jsx, where nothing could test it and
// nothing could see it. It was moved out for the same reason goalTargets.js,
// sessionStats.js and chartSlots.js were moved out before it: the judgment in
// here is worth proving, and proving it should not mean loading a screen, a
// chart library and a DOM. Its tests are in swingGenerator.test.js.
//
// Three things it now does that it did not before, all aimed at one complaint:
// on the Power goal, 56 percent of generated sessions used to put nothing at
// all inside the orange target band, and a chart with an empty target reads as
// broken software rather than as a hard practice session.
//
//   1. Exit velocity and launch angle come off the same swing (see below).
//   2. A player working on Power slowly gets the ball in the air.
//   3. A session that would render a completely empty band is re-rolled once.
//
// What it deliberately does not do: chase a better-looking session. The re-roll
// happens once and keeps whatever it gets. Everything else here is the demo's
// existing behaviour, carried across unchanged, including the 65/35 chance that
// a session trends better than the last one and the variance factor, both of
// which are settled product decisions recorded in the decision log.

// How much of a swing's spread comes from one shared quality of contact rather
// than from two unrelated accidents. Exit velocity and launch angle used to be
// drawn completely independently, which is why a hitter averaging 17 degrees
// essentially never produced a swing that was hard AND well angled: the two
// numbers had to get lucky separately. Real batted balls do not work that way,
// because a barrel is both at once.
//
// The independent share is the arithmetic that keeps the total spread the same
// as before, so the charts do not visibly tighten just because the two numbers
// now agree with each other: 0.6 squared plus 0.8 squared is 1.

//
// It is a ramp rather than a flat lift because a flat +5 scored marginally
// better and read far worse: it moves session 2's average launch angle five and
// a half degrees in a single round of batting practice, which is exactly the
// kind of impossible number this slice exists to remove. The ramp lands session
// 2 at 19.9 degrees and session 4 at 23.8, which is a player making progress
